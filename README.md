# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Twitter is one of the most popular social platforms today where people share their views and opinions on various events. Sentiment analysis can measure customer satisfaction and help companies to better improve their products. To make a better sentiment analysis, they usually extract information from social platforms like Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays a vital role in the field of Twitter Sentiment Analysis. NLP technology can help in pre-processing by cleaning the text, punctuation and eliminating special characters. For example, removing stop words such as ”I”, ”my”, ”our”, ”was” and ”is”.
The objective of this project is to develop a sentiment analyzer that addresses the challenges of accurately identifying the sentiments (positive or negative) within Twitter tweets. The proposed solution involves implementing a neural network using the TensorFlow framework. We will use three methods: machine learning, deep learning, and a combination of machine learning and deep learning simultaneously, to compare and analyze the most suitable model for the sentiment analyzer.
